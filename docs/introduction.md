# Introduction

`elang` is a computer programming language designed to serve the needs of engineering practitioners of various technical disciplines.

`elang` strives to be both a computation and an engineering documentation platform.

In the practice of engineering, professionals often have to perform calculations as well as communicate the outcomes of those calculations to various audiences. `elang` and `elang notebooks` provide a set of tools to perform both tasks.

In the following sections, we provide the reasoning and motivation behind the creation of `elang` and highlight its main features.

# The Codification of Engineering Knowledge

Since the dawn of civilisation, humanity has sought to learn and predict the way the world works. Our species has the unique ability to acquire, accumulate and transmit knowlege. This capability has allowed us to build new and more complex tools on top of those discovered and created by previous generations.

Engineering is the formal organisation and practical application of this knowledge. It is thanks to engineering that we have tools and infrastructure that improves the life of everyone on this planet.

The practice of engineering requires the understanding of patterns, the documenation of their behaviour using mathematical tools and the application of these concepts to solve problems in novel, more effective and efficient ways.
